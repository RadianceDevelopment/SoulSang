Soul Sanguisuge is a mod that allows you to gather Monster Souls (which are currently crafted with various mob drops, but I plan to make them actually drop soonâ„¢) and convert them into useful gear.

It's intended to be used alongside mods that expand the game past the Moon Lord (such as Calamity and Thorium), but can be used by itself.

An upgradable sword (has 10 levels and 2 optional forms)

Upgradable accesories for the Warrior (melee), Ranger, and Summoner classes

A couple accessories related to health and health regen
