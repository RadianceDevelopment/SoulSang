Soul Sanguisuge is a mod that allows you to gather Monster Souls (which are currently crafted with various mob drops, but I plan to make them actually drop soonâ„¢) and convert them into useful gear.

It's intended to be used alongside mods that expand the game past the Moon Lord (such as Calamity and Thorium), but can be used by itself.

Current content:

Recipe for the Slime Staff

An upgradable sword (has 10 levels and 2 optional forms)

~20-ish new accessories (most of which are able to be upgraded throughout the game)

2 new buffs 
- 2 potions that activate the new buffs

A new healing potion past Super

A few food item (gives Well Fed for 7 minutes)

4 items that can be crafted early on to store your Coins in (because why not?)
