Upgradable Gear is a mod that allows you to gather Monster Souls (which are crafted with mob drops, but I plan to make them actually drop soon) and convert them into useful gear.

It's intended to be used alongside mods that expand the game past the Moon Lord (such as Calamity and Thorium), but can be used by itself.

Currently adds 12 Swords and 6 Accesssories (all for the melee class rn)
